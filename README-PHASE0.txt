Nolan's Everything Site — Phase 0 Scaffold
==========================================
Generated: 2025-09-01

What this includes
------------------
• Full folder structure matching the blueprint (placeholders only).
• Empty page files (minimal comments) ready for real content.
• Data skeletons in /assets/data with headers and empty JSON arrays.
• Example slugs to show naming conventions.
• .gitkeep files to preserve empty directories in Git.

Next steps
----------
1) Drop this entire folder into your GitHub repo (root).
2) Commit with message: "foundation: add phase 0 scaffold".
3) Start filling data CSV/JSON files; add proofs into /assets/docs.
4) Replace example pages/slugs with your actual entries.
5) (Optional) Create CHANGELOG later at /changelog.html.

Conventions
-----------
• Slugs: lowercase-with-hyphens
• Dates: YYYY-MM-DD
• Record IDs: date + slug (e.g., 2025-09-01-hello-world)

Safety/Privacy
--------------
Keep sensitive items in docs/ as needed and link selectively.
